1. Would you please check if the function my_score() in tune_parameter.py is correct?
I want to use it to optimize precision and recall. If it is correct, if I change it to

def my_score():
    return make_scorer(recall_score, precision_score, f1_score)

an error will be raised:

ValueError: Can't handle mix of binary and continuous-multioutput
