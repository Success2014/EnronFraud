1.
In tune_parameter.py, I have rewritten the two_scorer function.
But in two_score function, only recall is returned.
So, I'm not sure will GridSearchCV tune precision and recall be optimized simultaneously?

2.
If I want to tune more than 2 parameters, say: precision, recall and accuracy, should I do it this way?


def Precision(y_true, y_pred):
    prec = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
    print "Precision: %2.3f" % prec
    return prec

def Recall(y_true, y_pred):
    reca = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
    print "Recall: %2.3f" % reca
    return reca

def Accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    accu = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    return accu

def three_score(y_true, y_pred):
    Precision(y_true, y_pred)
    Accuracy(y_true, y_pred)
    score = Recall(y_true, y_pred)
    return score

def three_scorer():
    return make_scorer(three_score, greater_is_better=True)


clf = GridSearchCV(pipe_line, parameters, cv=3, scoring = three_scorer())
